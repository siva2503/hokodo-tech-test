## Test Scope

Only `Quotes` REST API endpoints of HOKODO API service are undert scope of testing. Performance, automation testing are are considered out of scope for test design due to time limitation.

## Testing Tools

1. [BDD Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/docs/guides/overview/) for test design.
2. Hokodo's documentation from [here](https://api.docs.hokodo.co/#quotes) is used for test case design activity.

## Test cases

Test cases designed are stored under [testCases](testCases) folder in BDD format.
