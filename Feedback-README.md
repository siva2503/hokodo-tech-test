## Feedback

note: the points below are my opinions and items that I feel could help other candidates.

1. The exercises provided are really interesting and definitely helped me to showcase my Quality assurance knowledge as it covers many of the important duties of an experienced QA engineer.
   - The time limit recommended(2-4 hours) is enough to get a solution ready but wouldn’t let candidate to showcase their skills to full potential as it contains more than one category(test strategy creation, bug hunt, automation test design) and requires gaining understanding of two platforms (API Service & APP).
2. I loved doing the bug hunt activity & it helped me to understand the product better. Hope I uncovered one important bug in DirectDebit section. [More about it here](./exercise-2-frontend-app/BugReports/RealIssues/P1-FronendIssue-DefaultDirectDebit.md)
3. Clearer expectation in the Test strategy exercise would help. A “test strategy document” normally should not contain test cases, but only scope of testing, planning & mitigation details. Rather “Test case document” is the deliverable document that should contain all test cases. Instructions mentioning both Test Strategy & Test cases is a bit confusing. I really appreciate the provided liberty to choose a document that I see as best fit, but it may lead candidates to choose the kind of document they are familiar with(or good at) and might become a factor that cannot be compared between candidates.

   - With assumption that the expectation is to create test cases, I have added a write up that includes all test cases but also with few test strategy topics. Please correct me if the expectation is a Test strategy document.

4. Given automation exercise is fantastic & I liked the approach of providing minimal number of payment links, helped me to plan, prepare & design before going about automation instead of trying the journey while designing. I did find iFrames in the web application which is always a challenging piece from automation standpoint and did help me to showcase my automation testing skills.

5. A mention about the minimum number of test cases expected(manual or automation) would really help to limit candidate’s time. It could help candidates to submit the most important testcases, instead of drafting huge number of edge cases that is of little value.
